# ドルール (drool) 🤤 [![built with garnix](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgarnix.io%2Fapi%2Fbadges%2Fmjvmroz%2Fdrool%3Fbranch%3Dmaster)](https://garnix.io/repo/mjvmroz/drool)

A work-in-progress [lox 🐟](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) bytecode interpreter, written in Rust 🦀.

"Drool" because crab stuffed salmon is an insanely decadent, guilty pleasure which produces this response.

This project likely won't do that, as it's my first foray into the language.

## Approach

I'm trying to squeeze performance out of the VM, but am sacrificing a little for ergonomics in the dis/assembler, scanner and compiler.

It's possible that I'm losing a little juice through memory waste when decoding instructions in the VM. I think Rust _should_ be able to understand through my inlining that the VM's use of the `Op` struct is transient in release builds, but I'm not 100% sure. 🐢
